Static graph extraction
	- Extract one graph for each volume? 
	- Cycle?

Dynamic network extraction
   - Implement window-based approach 
   - Implement narrative smoothing
	- (test on the toy example)

Topological properties:
	- Compute them automatically
	- Compare them

Stats part:
- Goal: study the effect of the extraction parameters
	- window size
	- overlap
	- extraction method
- Methods:
	- standard topological measures:
		- how they evolve with the parameters
		- for nodal measures, we could study how they are rank-correlated (for 2 different parameter values)
		  (in addition to studyig changes in absolute value)
	- also consider global similarity measures between graphs
	- Identify which measures are used in apps of char nets (in the literature)
	  >> study how these are affected by extraction parameters
