Static graph extraction
	- Extract one graph for each volume
      Plot a panel of these volumes (for a given series) (>> don't remember what I meant there)
	- For each narrative arc?

Dynamic network extraction
   - Implement window-based approach (<< isn't this already done?)
   - Implement narrative smoothing
	 - (test on the toy example)

Topological measures
	- include the harmonic closeness (leverage Trajan code)
	- weighted measures: sometimes weights=relation intensity, but sometimes weights=distance
	  >> sometimes normalize or take the reciprocal or something

Stats part:
- Goal: study the effect of the extraction parameters
	- window size
	- overlap
	- extraction method
- Methods:
	- standard topological measures:
		- how they evolve with the parameters
		- for nodal measures, we could study how they are rank-correlated (for 2 different parameter values)
		  (in addition to studying changes in absolute value)
	- also consider global similarity measures between graphs
	- Identify which nodal measures are used in apps of char nets (in the literature)
	  >> study how these are affected by extraction parameters
	- assess the difference between parameters on a simple task such as story segmentation (ref=segments or volumes?)
	  >> maybe in a different paper

- Segments: weights=occurrences vs. durations
  - compare them, are they correlated?

- Plots:
  - Plots combining the different assortativities / centralizations? 
    (for comparison purposes. not sure of the interest)
  - Check the violin plots
  
- Segmentation task: 
  - requires dynamic nets
  - maybe do that in a separate paper
- This first work:
  - descriptive study of the segment-based networks
  - compare with other fictional character networks properties
  - assess window-based approaches as approximations
    - compare how good the window corresponding to the typical segment length is
  - study the effect on some simple tools from the literature 
    (eg main character detection through combination of centrality measures)

Method to compare between bédés
  - just compare segment-based graphs (through their topological measures)
    >> can be done through tables (?)
  - also compare to other types of character networks
  - compare the best window-based parameters

Plot comparison  
  - Compare nets extracted from one-shot albums (e.g. Astérix): 
    can we find archetypical roles coming back in each album?
    >> need a way to find narratively equivalent characters (nodes) from album to album
    - Can we distinguish between the different writers (uderzo, gosciny, ferri)?
  - We'll probably need to perform some kind of alignment task at some point

Changes:
  - remove links whose weight is under some threshold (e.g. determined from some stat computed over the whole node/link set)
    >> OK for the segments, but how to do that for the window-based nets?
  - plot centrality changes over only the top k most central nodes
    (don't we care about the other characters?)
    >> or consider classes of centrality? (use some clustering tool to detect them automatically)
  - in plots: use violins rather than boxplots

Paper:
  - Extraction methods
    - explain the issues and the manual processing
    - is it worth detecting scenes?
      >> compare scene- vs. window-based nets
  - Descriptive analysis of Thorgal's net
