Static graph extraction
	- Extract one graph for each volume? 
	- Each arc?

Dynamic network extraction
   - Implement window-based approach 
   - Implement narrative smoothing
	- (test on the toy example)

Stats part:
- Goal: study the effect of the extraction parameters
	- window size
	- overlap
	- extraction method
- Methods:
	- standard topological measures:
		- how they evolve with the parameters
		- for nodal measures, we could study how they are rank-correlated (for 2 different parameter values)
		  (in addition to studying changes in absolute value)
	- also consider global similarity measures between graphs
	- Identify which measures are used in apps of char nets (in the literature)
	  >> study how these are affected by extraction parameters
	- assess the difference between parameters on a simple task such as story segmentation (ref=segments or volumes?)

- Segments: weights=occurrences vs. durations
  - compare them, correlated ?

- Plots:
  - Spearman correlation plots (handled as any graph measure)
  - Node ranking plot (similar to multiplex centrality paper)
