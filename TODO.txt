Static graph extraction
	- Extract one graph for each volume? 
	- Cycle?

Dynamic network extraction
   - Implement window-based approach 
   - Implement narrative smoothing
	- (test on the toy example)

Define a specific function for the conversion process when dealing with other file formats

Topological properties:
	- Compute them automatically
	- Compare them

Nodal attributes:
    - We could easily define tables describing characters
      - Gender
      - Ralph Azham >> bleui or not
      - Others?
    >> interest: compute measures such as homophily
    - Store that in a specific table.
